    title: 'The Radical Cost of the Cross',
    info: 'The cross of Christ is the most recognizable symbol in the world, yet no one fully knows its meaning. It is a profound mystery. On it, Christ paid a tremendous price for you. God is satisfied with what Jesus did for you on the cross. Are you? (Was "When God Flexes His Muscles.")',

    title: 'Right On Time: Expecting Jesus, Then and Now',
    info: 'Was it a surprise when Jesus, God’s Son, was born in Bethlehem? Not if you read the Old Testament carefully. His first coming was prophesied for centuries. Will it be a surprise when Jesus returns for His church? Not if we read the New Testament carefully. In fact, the faithful are already expecting Him. In this brief doctrinal survey, Dr. J. Vernon McGee tells us the secret to expecting Jesus, then and now. It’s as simple as this: Believe Him. (Was "They Should Have Expected Him, and So Should We.")',

    title: `Tested and True: Lessons on Faith from God's Classroom`,
    info: `James seems to have little in common with contemporary Christianity as we know it today. James was austere, rugged, serious, and solemn. He was also very practical. He believed Christianity had to be put in shoe leather. If you couldn’t walk it out, then it wasn’t true Christianity. So he took us to God's classroom and described what a faith that works looks like. Practically speaking, he wrote about the skills and techniques we need to faithfully live the Christian life. (From the Sunday Sermon, "The Entrance Exams to God's University.")`,

    title: 'True Worship: What It Takes to Really Praise the Lord',
    info: '(Psalm 150) What does it take to really worship God? If you’re honest, you know what it means to stand in church and sing the words with everyone else (maybe even pray or kneel or lift up your hands and face to God) but wonder if what you’re doing is really worship. The truth is, maybe it is—and maybe it isn’t. Find out what God loves to hear from you in this honest study in Psalm 150. One little verse will change the way you sing and praise Him for the rest of your life. (Was "What is Worship?")',

    title: 'What it Takes to be Forgiven',
    info: `Aside from killing Goliath, David is probably best known for his sin with Bathsheba. This message presents four things that happen to every believer when they sin, while at the same time asserting that God offers forgiveness to those who love Him. David repented and was forgiven—if God hadn't forgiven him, there would be no hope for our own forgiveness. (From the Sunday Sermon, "David and the Wife of Uriah.")`,
